# sortingVisualizer
Visualization of sorting algorithms

# Dependencies
Python 3
Pygame for drawing to the screen - pip install pygame
noise for creating more visually appealing randomness - pip install noise

# How to run
navigate to the sortingVisualizer directory.

python main.py


# Implemented algorithms
Each algorithm is implemented in its own class.

Bubble Sort

Gravity Sort

Insertion Sort

Pancake Sort

Quick Sort

Radix Sort

Shell Sort

I chose to implement these algorithms to achieve a mix of functional vs interesting. 

### Notice

Each algorithm is implemented slightlty differently than would be typically seen in a normal program.

Each sort is broken up into distinct steps that lead to the final goal. Each frame of animation a single step is played.

This is why each sort is broken up into a few methods in the implementation.
